    <hr>
    <p class = "textUpCentre">I'm Basil and I want to work as an apprentice programmer. I've always been interesting in writing code and am putting all of my effort in to making it a career.</p>
    <p class = "textUpCentre">I have completed a course with <a href = "https://wearecodenation.com/">Code Nation</a>, titled "<i>Level 2 Certificate in IT User Skills (Open Systems and Enterprise) (ITQ)</i>", which taught me how to use Python, HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p class = "textUpCentre">I have taught myself several languages over the years and don't want it to just be a hobby. I prefer back-end work, though I am open to front-end. Full stack as well.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class = "textUpCentre"p>On the <a href = "aboutme.html">About Me</a> page, there are some examples of projects I've done in the past with screenshots.</p>
    <p class = "textUpCentre">On the <a href = "codesamples.html">Code Samples</a> page, I have snippets of code that showcase the different uses of the code I can write.</p>
    <p class = "textUpCentre">If you'd like to speak to me about possible employment, want to discuss code in general or just want to play Rocket League then head to the <a href = "contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>
    <p class = "textUpCentre">Thanks for visiting!</p>
