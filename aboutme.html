        <p>I've been interested in coding for a long time and am mainly self-taught. I studied A2 Computing in college back in 2005 and have been coding in different languages along the way.</p>

<div class = "textUpCentre">
    <p>These languages include: 
        <div class = "codetextUpCentre">     
            <br>HTML, CSS, XML
            <br>Python
            <br>Java, Javascript, Actionscript
            <br>C++, C#
            <br>Visual Basic
            <br>Assembly Language

        <p>I've written code for several purposes, mainly to keep up to date and refresh my knowledge over the years. I have also made several mods for different video games. The most recent one I did was a weapons pack for Rimworld as I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could do it. The mod itself was published on the Steam workshop so that people could use it themselves in their games. It has entirely positive reviews and over one thousand downloads </p>

    <div class = "textUpCentre">
        <p>Prior to making mods for games, I also created a character sheet for use in a tabletop game that is based on Dungeons and Dragons 5e. The character sheet is entirely built in HTML and CSS as it uses built in functions of the website, Roll20. The sheet itself allows players to enter their characters attributes and make dice rolls based off of them. They can also input details in about any weapons they have and also attack enemies with dice rolls in the game. This project took three weeks to complete, with little prior knowledge of HTML or CSS.</p>
